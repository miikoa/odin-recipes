        <p class="title"> Chili</p>
    
        <p>Everyone and his mother loves chili. 
        Am I wrong? Well, as winter has just begun, chili is on our mind.  
        To make a big pot of chili isn't rocket science. 
        All it takes is basic, high quality ingredients and a little bit of love. 
        There are as many chili recipes as there are people walking this earth but 
        most will agree that all chili recipes have a core base of ingredients such 
        as kidney beans, tomato sauce and spicy sauce.  
        From there, the sky is the limit.  If you'd like for me to hold your hand,
         check out the step by step information below.
