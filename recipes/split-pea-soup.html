        <p><h1><strong> potage Saint Germain or pea soup  </strong></h1></p>
        <p>I grew up on <a href="http://historysdumpster.blogspot.com/2014/11/soup-starter.html">Soup Starter</a>
           and I thought that this was how everyone made soup.  It was not until moving to France years later and taking a year long cooking class, 'cuisine traditionelle française', 
           that I realized that this was not the case after all. The recipe that I am presenting here 
          is the one that I learned during that class.  Bon appetit!
