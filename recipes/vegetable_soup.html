        <p><h1><strong> pea soup or potage de Saint Germain for a 4 people</strong></h1></p>
        <p>
            Before providing my soup recipe, I must confess that I grewup on 
            soup starter. As a kid, I thought that this was how everyone made soup.  After
            moving to France,  I took a year-long cuisine traditionelle fran√ßaise I 
            realized that this was not the case after all. The recipe that I am presenting here 
            is the one that I learned during that class.
